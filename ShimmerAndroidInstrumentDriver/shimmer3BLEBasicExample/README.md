# Shimmer3 BLE Basic Example
This example is only applicable for Shimmer3 with BLE support onwards

- Set Shimmer3 macAddress to be used in MainActivity
- Run the example to Connect(pairing is not required), Disconnect, Start and Stop Streaming with the device
- Enable LN Accel in order to see the data when streaming, otherwise only Timestamp will be printed out
- You will require using a firmware that supports BLE (e.g. https://github.com/ShimmerResearch/shimmer3/releases/tag/LogAndStream_Shimmer3_BLE_v0.16.002) note this firwmare is a PRERELEASE, and is only to allow you to try the BLE radio on the Shimmer3. We recommend checking the releases to make sure you have the latest supported FW. 
- Note that not all Shimmer3 radios support this you can check whether your Shimmer3 radios supports this by using Consensys and check that it is using BT:RN6478 rather than BT:RN42
